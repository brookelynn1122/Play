Today I am starting my lab notebook. As well as attempting to work with the Latex software and Github. However, it is proving difficult. I am not exactly sure how to push my data to the github cite, or pull from the github cite. My meeting is tomorrow at 11:00 and the only thing I am going to have to show for it is this entry in this lab notebook. I have been looking at forums only and trying to figure out how to push/pull with github from the command line however I am still having difficulties.
		\subparagraph{Latex and Github}
Writing in these is not that difficult, however I am having a problem pushing and pulling. (Thinking about creating my own private journal using this for practice, could be easy to organize and would say on money and the environment).
